# Pace Calculation & Training Zones

## Determining Training Paces

### From Recent Race Times

Use recent race performances to calculate training paces. Races must be from last 2-3 months for accuracy.

**Standard race time equivalents (for similar fitness):**
- 5K time × 2.1 ≈ 10K time
- 10K time × 2.17 ≈ Half marathon time
- Half marathon time × 2.11 ≈ Marathon time

**Jack Daniels VDOT Method (simplified):**

1. Get recent race time (5K, 10K, half, full)
2. Use online calculator (JackDaniels Running Calculator) or estimate
3. Calculate training paces from VDOT

**Quick estimation without calculator:**

If runner has recent 5K time, approximate paces:
- **Easy pace**: Add 2-3 min/mile to 5K pace
- **Marathon pace**: Add 1.5-2 min/mile to 5K pace  
- **Tempo pace**: Add 30-45 sec/mile to 5K pace
- **Interval pace**: Subtract 10-15 sec/mile from 5K pace

### From Conversational Pace

If no recent race times, ask for their comfortable conversational pace.

**Conversational Pace = Easy Pace**

From this, estimate:
- **Tempo pace**: Subtract 45-60 sec/mile from easy pace
- **5K race pace**: Subtract 2-3 min/mile from easy pace
- **Interval pace**: Subtract 2.5-3.5 min/mile from easy pace
- **Long run pace**: Easy pace or 15-30 sec slower

### Self-Test Options

**Option 1: Timed Mile**
- Warm up 10-15 minutes
- Run 1 mile as hard as possible on track or flat route
- Use this as baseline for calculations
- Mile pace × 1.1 = approximate 5K pace
- Mile pace × 1.2 = approximate 10K pace

**Option 2: Talk Test**
- Easy pace: Can speak in complete sentences
- Tempo pace: Can speak in short phrases, some breathlessness
- Threshold pace: Can only say a few words at a time
- Interval pace: Cannot hold conversation

## Training Zone Descriptions

### Zone 1: Recovery Pace
**Purpose**: Active recovery between hard efforts

**Characteristics:**
- Very comfortable, could run all day
- Can easily hold conversation
- Should feel "too easy"
- RPE 1-3 out of 10

**Pace guideline**: Easy pace + 30-60 sec/mile

**When to use:**
- Day after hard workout or long run
- Between interval sets for recovery jogs
- When feeling fatigued but need to move

### Zone 2: Easy/Aerobic Pace
**Purpose**: Build aerobic base, most training volume occurs here

**Characteristics:**
- Conversational pace - can speak in full sentences
- Comfortable, sustainable for hours

- Strides
- Race-specific work for 5K and below
- Limited use for distance training

## Workout Type Definitions

### Easy Run
- **Pace**: Zone 2 (conversational)
- **Duration**: 30-90 minutes typically
- **Purpose**: Aerobic base building, recovery
- **Example**: "45 minutes easy, conversational pace, probably around 9:30-10:00/mile based on your recent runs"

### Long Run
- **Pace**: Zone 2, sometimes finishing in Zone 3
- **Duration**: 90+ minutes, or 20-30% of weekly volume
- **Purpose**: Build endurance, mental toughness, fat adaptation
- **Example**: "12 miles at easy pace (9:30-10:00/mile), can progress to moderate effort (9:00/mile) for final 2-3 miles"

### Recovery Run
- **Pace**: Zone 1 (very easy)
- **Duration**: 20-40 minutes
- **Purpose**: Active recovery, maintain routine without stress
- **Example**: "30 minutes very easy, 10:00-10:30/mile, focus on form and feeling good"

### Tempo Run
- **Pace**: Zone 4 (threshold)
- **Duration**: 20-40 minutes continuous, or broken into intervals
- **Purpose**: Improve lactate threshold
- **Example**: "1 mile warmup, 25 minutes at tempo pace (8:15-8:30/mile - should feel comfortably hard), 1 mile cooldown"

### Interval Workout
- **Pace**: Zone 5 (VO2max) or Zone 6 (repetitions)
- **Duration**: Varies based on interval length
- **Purpose**: Improve speed, VO2max, running economy
- **Example**: "1 mile warmup, 6 × 800m at 5K pace (7:45/mile) with 400m jog recovery (2.5-3 min), 1 mile cooldown"

### Hill Repeats
- **Pace**: Effort-based (Zone 4-5)
- **Duration**: 30 seconds to 2 minutes uphill
- **Purpose**: Build strength, power, running economy
- **Example**: "1 mile warmup, 8 × 90 second hill repeats at hard effort (not sprint), jog down for recovery, 1 mile cooldown"

### Fartlek
- **Pace**: Variable (Zones 2-5)
- **Duration**: Varies
- **Purpose**: Introduce speed work, practice pace changes, mental break from structured workouts
- **Example**: "6 miles total: alternate 3 min hard (tempo effort), 2 min easy, throughout the middle 4 miles"

### Progression Run
- **Pace**: Start Zone 2, finish Zone 3-4
- **Duration**: 45-90 minutes
- **Purpose**: Practice negative splits, build confidence, simulate race fatigue
- **Example**: "8 miles: start at easy pace (9:30/mile), gradually increase each mile, finish last 2 miles at tempo pace (8:15-8:30/mile)"

### Strides
- **Pace**: Zone 6 (fast but controlled)
- **Duration**: 20-30 seconds per stride
- **Purpose**: Improve form, economy, neuromuscular recruitment
- **Example**: "After easy run, 4-6 × 20 second strides at ~90% effort with full recovery walk back"
- **Note**: Should be added to easy runs 1-2× per week

## Pace Adjustment Factors

### Environmental Conditions

**Heat and Humidity:**
- 60-70°F: Slow easy pace by 0-10 sec/mile
- 70-80°F: Slow by 10-30 sec/mile  
- 80-90°F: Slow by 30-60 sec/mile
- 90°F+: Slow significantly or move workout indoors
- Adjust harder for high humidity (>70%)

**Cold:**
- <32°F: Allow 5-15 sec/mile slower for first 10-15 min (warmup)
- Typically less impact than heat once warmed up
- Ice/snow: Major pace adjustments for safety

**Altitude:**
- Every 1,000 ft elevation: ~2-3% slower pace
- 5,000 ft: ~10-15 sec/mile slower
- Allow 2-3 weeks for partial adaptation

**Wind:**
- Strong headwind: 10-30 sec/mile slower
- Run by effort, not pace on windy days

### Terrain

**Trail Running:**
- Technical single track: 30-90 sec/mile slower than road
- Fire roads/easy trails: 10-30 sec/mile slower
- Extremely technical: 2-3 min/mile slower
- Focus on effort and time, not pace

**Hills:**
- Uphill: Effort-based, pace irrelevant
- Downhill: Control pace, don't "free fall"
- Rolling hills: 10-30 sec/mile slower than flat roads

### Fatigue State

**Well-rested:** Can hit prescribed paces
**Moderate fatigue:** Slow easy pace by 10-20 sec/mile
**High fatigue:** Consider day off or very easy recovery run
**After hard workout/race:** Slow by 30-60 sec/mile for 24-48 hours

## Common Pacing Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Running Easy Days Too Hard
**Problem**: Most common error. Running Zone 3 when should be Zone 2.
**Fix**: Force yourself to slow down. If in doubt, go slower.
**Why it matters**: Prevents recovery, builds fatigue, reduces quality of hard workouts.

### Mistake 2: Running Hard Days Too Easy
**Problem**: Not hitting appropriate intensity on workout days.
**Fix**: If prescribed tempo pace, run actual tempo pace (not slower).
**Why it matters**: Stimulus insufficient for adaptation.

### Mistake 3: Racing Every Workout
**Problem**: Trying to set PRs on every tempo or interval session.
**Fix**: Save races for actual races. Training is training.
**Why it matters**: Accumulates fatigue, increases injury risk, leads to burnout.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Conditions
**Problem**: Forcing prescribed paces regardless of heat, wind, hills.
**Fix**: Adjust for conditions. Run by effort when needed.
**Why it matters**: Can lead to overexertion, heat illness, or poor recovery.

### Mistake 5: Comparing to Others
**Problem**: Running based on training partners' paces instead of own zones.
**Fix**: Train at YOUR paces, not someone else's.
**Why it matters**: Everyone's zones are different based on fitness.

## Pace Communication Tips for Plans

Always provide paces with CONTEXT:

**Good:**
"5 miles easy pace, conversational, probably around 9:30-10:00 min/mile based on your 10K time"

**Not as good:**
"5 miles at 9:30-10:00 pace"

**Best:**
"5 miles easy - this should feel comfortable and you should be able to hold a conversation. Based on your recent 55-minute 10K, aim for around 9:30-10:00 min/mile, but go slower if needed to stay conversational. Better too slow than too fast on easy days."

Include:
1. The effort/feeling
2. The purpose
3. The estimated pace range
4. Permission to adjust based on feel
