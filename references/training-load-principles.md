# Training Load Principles

## Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR)

### What is ACWR?

The Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio compares short-term training load (acute = last 7 days) to long-term training load (chronic = average of last 28 days or 4 weeks).

**Formula:** ACWR = Acute Load (1 week) / Chronic Load (4-week average)

### Safe Training Zones

- **0.8-1.3 (Sweet Spot)**: Lowest injury risk (4-5%). Optimal training progression.
- **<0.8 (Undertraining)**: May lead to detraining. Body isn't maintaining fitness.
- **1.3-1.5 (Caution Zone)**: Moderate injury risk (7-10%). Acceptable for short periods.
- **>1.5 (Danger Zone)**: High injury risk (15-20%+). Avoid sustained periods in this zone.

### Key Principles

1. **Spikes are risky**: Sudden increases in training load significantly increase injury risk.
2. **Context matters**: ACWR >1.5 for 1 week may be acceptable; sustained >1.5 for multiple weeks is dangerous.
3. **Individual variation**: Some athletes tolerate higher ratios; others need more conservative approaches.

## Weekly Load Progression Guidelines

### Experience-Based Progression

**Novice Runners (0-1 year experience)**
- Weekly increase: 5-10% maximum
- Method: Increase based on TIME first (not distance)
- Focus: Building aerobic base and running habit
- Conservative approach required due to tissue adaptation needs

**Intermediate Runners (1-3 years experience)**
- Weekly increase: 10-15% typical, up to 20% for short periods
- Can use distance-based progression
- Should incorporate deload weeks

**Experienced Runners (3+ years experience)**
- Weekly increase: Can tolerate 20-25% for 1-2 weeks
- Must be followed by stabilization or deload
- Higher chronic loads provide buffer for larger increases

### Chronic Load Considerations

**Low chronic load (<20 miles/week or equivalent)**
- Smaller increases recommended (5-10%)
- Body has less adaptation to stress
- Slower progression needed

**Moderate chronic load (20-50 miles/week or equivalent)**
- Can handle 10-20% increases
- Balance between progression and safety

**High chronic load (>50 miles/week or equivalent)**
- May only tolerate 5-10% increases
- Already at high stress levels
- Risk of overtraining increases

## Deload Weeks

### Purpose
Allow body to recover, adapt, and absorb training stress. Critical for preventing cumulative fatigue and injury.

### Implementation

**Standard Protocol: 3 weeks up, 1 week down**
- Week 1: Build
- Week 2: Build  
- Week 3: Build (peak of cycle)
- Week 4: Deload (reduce to ~60-70% of peak week volume)

**Alternative: 2 weeks up, 1 week down**
- More frequent recovery
- Better for injury-prone runners or high intensity periods

### Deload Week Structure
- Reduce volume by 30-40% (not intensity)
- Maintain some quality work to avoid detraining
- Can include easy runs and one moderate workout
- Focus on recovery: sleep, nutrition, mobility

## Progressive Loading: One Variable at a Time

**CRITICAL RULE**: Change only ONE training variable at a time

**The Three Variables:**
1. **Frequency**: Number of runs per week
2. **Duration**: Total weekly mileage/time
3. **Intensity**: Pace, effort level, or workout difficulty

**Why?**
Runners who change multiple variables simultaneously have significantly higher injury rates.

**Progression Examples:**

*Correct Approach:*
- Weeks 1-4: Increase frequency from 3 to 4 days/week (keep volume & intensity constant)
- Weeks 5-8: Increase volume by 10% weekly (keep frequency & intensity constant)
- Weeks 9-12: Add one tempo run per week (keep volume & frequency constant)

*Incorrect Approach:*
- Week 1: 3 days, 15 miles, all easy
- Week 2: 4 days, 18 miles, add intervals ❌ (changed all three variables)

## Training Intensity Distribution

### The 80/20 Rule

**80% Easy/Low Intensity**
- Conversational pace
- Heart rate Zone 2 (if tracking HR)
- RPE 3-5 out of 10
- Purpose: Build aerobic base, allow recovery

**20% Moderate/High Intensity**
- Tempo runs, intervals, hill work
- Heart rate Zone 3+ (if tracking HR)
- RPE 7-9 out of 10
- Purpose: Improve speed, lactate threshold, VO2max

### Why 80/20?

1. **Injury prevention**: Most miles at low stress reduces breakdown
2. **Aerobic development**: Easy running builds mitochondrial density and capillary networks
3. **Quality work**: Fresher for hard workouts when they matter
4. **Sustainable**: Can maintain training load without burnout

### Common Mistake
Runners often run "moderate" pace (too hard for easy days, too easy for hard workouts). This leads to:
- Inadequate recovery
- Insufficient intensity on hard days
- Higher injury risk
- Plateau in performance

**Fix**: Run easy runs EASY. Run hard days HARD. No in-between.

## Calculating Training Load

### Simple Method: Weekly Mileage
- Just track total miles per week
- Easy to calculate ACWR
- Limitation: Doesn't account for intensity

### RPE-Based Method (sRPE)
1. After each run, rate effort 1-10
2. Multiply: Duration (minutes) × RPE = Training Load
3. Sum all runs in week for weekly load

**Example:**
- Monday: 30 min × RPE 3 = 90
- Wednesday: 45 min × RPE 6 = 270
- Friday: 30 min × RPE 3 = 90
- Sunday: 60 min × RPE 5 = 300
- **Weekly Load: 750**

### Advanced: Training Stress Score (TSS)
Used by apps/watches. Accounts for duration, intensity, and fitness level. More accurate but requires technology.

## Injury Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Factors
- ACWR >1.5 sustained for multiple weeks
- Rapid increase in training (>25% weekly for novices)
- Changing multiple variables simultaneously
- Low chronic training load with aggressive progression
- Previous injury to same area within 6 months
- Age >40 with limited running history
- Running >80% of miles at moderate-hard effort

### Moderate-Risk Factors
- ACWR 1.3-1.5 for multiple weeks
- Inconsistent training (high variability week-to-week)
- Minimal or no deload weeks
- Previous injury to different area within 12 months
- Limited strength training or cross-training

### Low-Risk Factors
- ACWR consistently 0.8-1.3
- Gradual progression with planned deload weeks
- Changing one variable at a time
- High chronic training load (well-adapted)
- Strong training history without recent injuries
- Complementary strength training program
- Good sleep and recovery habits

## Practical Application

### When to Push (Higher ACWR acceptable)
- Short-term peaks (1-2 weeks) before deload
- Race-specific training phases
- Athlete has high chronic load
- No injury history or current niggles
- Good recovery markers (sleep, appetite, mood)

### When to Hold Back (Lower ACWR needed)
- Coming back from injury or illness
- Building base after off-season
- Athlete has low chronic load
- Multiple stressors (work, life, travel)
- Signs of overtraining (fatigue, elevated resting HR, poor sleep)
- Age >40 or injury-prone

### Red Flags to Decrease Load Immediately
- Pain that persists >24 hours after a run
- Pain that increases during a run
- Persistent fatigue despite rest days
- Declining performance despite training
- Loss of motivation or mood changes
- Resting heart rate elevated >5-10 bpm from normal
