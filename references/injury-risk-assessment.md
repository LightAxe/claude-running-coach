# Injury Risk Assessment Framework

## Initial Assessment Questions

When creating a training plan, gather this information to assess injury risk:

### Training History
1. **Years running consistently**: 
   - <1 year = Novice (highest risk)
   - 1-3 years = Intermediate (moderate risk)
   - 3+ years = Experienced (lower risk if progressed properly)

2. **Recent training volume** (last 4 weeks average):
   - Low chronic load (<15 miles/week) = Higher risk with increases
   - Moderate (15-40 miles/week) = Standard risk
   - High (40+ miles/week) = Can tolerate more, but watch for overtraining

3. **Training consistency**:
   - Sporadic/on-off = Higher risk
   - Consistent = Lower risk
   - Coming back from break >2 weeks = Treat as returning from injury

### Injury History
1. **Recent injuries** (last 6 months):
   - Same area injury = HIGH RISK for re-injury
   - Different area = Moderate risk
   - No injuries = Lower risk

2. **Chronic/recurring injuries**:
   - Pattern of same injury = Need conservative approach + address root cause
   - Multiple different injuries = May indicate training errors or biomechanical issues

3. **Current pain or discomfort**:
   - Any current pain >2/10 = Address before increasing load
   - Persistent soreness = May need recovery before progression
   - No issues = Can proceed with appropriate progression

### Personal Factors
1. **Age**:
   - <30 = Generally more resilient
   - 30-40 = Moderate consideration
   - 40-50 = More conservative progression recommended
   - 50+ = Extended recovery, more conservative approach essential

2. **Prior athletic background**:
   - Former athlete = Better tissue adaptation
   - Sedentary background = Need more conservative approach
   - Recent background = Impact on tissue preparedness

3. **Lifestyle stress factors**:
   - High work stress = Reduce training load
   - Poor sleep (<7 hours) = Higher injury risk
   - Multiple life stressors = More conservative approach
   - Optimal recovery environment = Can handle more training

4. **Body composition**:
   - Significantly overweight = More conservative, emphasize easy mileage
   - Normal weight = Standard approach
   - Underweight/underfueling = Risk for bone stress injuries

### Goal Context
1. **Time to goal race**:
   - <8 weeks = Limited time, assess if realistic
   - 8-16 weeks = Good timeframe
   - 16+ weeks = Excellent for gradual progression

2. **Goal ambition level**:
   - Finish safely = Most conservative approach
   - Specific time goal = Balance ambition with safety
   - Aggressive PR attempt = Higher acceptable risk, but watch closely

3. **Race distance relative to experience**:
   - Same distance as trained before = Lower risk
   - Step up in distance = Moderate risk
   - Large jump (5K to marathon) = Need extended timeline

## Risk Scoring System

### Calculate Risk Score

Assign points for each factor:

**Training History:**
- Novice (<1 year): +3 points
- Intermediate (1-3 years): +1 point
- Experienced (3+ years): 0 points
- Inconsistent training: +2 points

**Injury History:**
- Recent injury to same area (<6 months): +4 points
- Recent injury to different area (<6 months): +2 points
- Chronic/recurring injuries: +3 points
- Current pain >2/10: +3 points
- No recent injuries: 0 points

**Personal Factors:**
- Age 40-50: +1 point
- Age 50+: +2 points
- High life stress or poor sleep: +2 points
- Significantly overweight: +2 points
- Former endurance athlete: -1 point

**Training Load:**
- Low chronic load (<15 mi/wk): +2 points
- Planning aggressive increases (>20%/week): +2 points
- No planned deload weeks: +1 point

**Goal Factors:**
- Aggressive timeline (<8 weeks): +2 points
- Large distance increase: +2 points

### Risk Categories

**Low Risk (0-4 points):**
- Can follow standard progression guidelines
- ACWR 0.8-1.3 target
- Weekly increases 10-15% acceptable
- Deload every 3-4 weeks

**Moderate Risk (5-9 points):**
- More conservative progression needed
- ACWR 0.8-1.2 target
- Weekly increases 5-10% recommended
- Deload every 3 weeks
- Monitor for warning signs closely

**High Risk (10+ points):**
- Very conservative approach essential
- ACWR 0.8-1.1 target
- Weekly increases 5% maximum
- Deload every 2-3 weeks
- Consider more frequent check-ins
- May need to adjust goal timeline

## Plan Adjustments Based on Risk

### For High-Risk Runners

1. **Extended base building phase**:
   - Spend 4-6 weeks building consistent volume
   - All easy running initially
   - No speed work until base established

2. **Slower progression**:
   - Add 1 run/week before increasing distance
   - Increase by 5% weekly maximum
   - Repeat weeks when in doubt

3. **More frequent deload**:
   - Every 2-3 weeks instead of 3-4
   - Drop volume by 40% on deload weeks

4. **Limited intensity**:
   - Delay speed work until 4-6 weeks into plan
   - One workout/week maximum during build
   - Focus on strides before formal workouts

5. **Built-in flexibility**:
   - Plan extra "buffer weeks" 
   - Include alternative plan if schedule disrupted
   - Prioritize consistency over speed

### For Moderate-Risk Runners

1. **Standard base building**:
   - 2-4 weeks establishing consistent volume
   - Mostly easy running to start

2. **Moderate progression**:
   - 5-10% weekly increases
   - Can progress frequency and volume, but separately

3. **Regular deload**:
   - Every 3 weeks
   - Drop volume by 30%

4. **Gradual intensity**:
   - Introduce workouts after 2-3 weeks
   - One workout/week initially, build to two

5. **Clear warning systems**:
   - Establish pain scale guidelines
   - Regular check-ins on fatigue

### For Low-Risk Runners

1. **Efficient base building**:
   - 1-2 weeks if maintaining fitness
   - Can include moderate efforts

2. **Standard progression**:
   - 10-15% weekly increases acceptable
   - Can progress two variables if spaced out

3. **Standard deload**:
   - Every 3-4 weeks
   - Drop volume by 30%

4. **Normal intensity**:
   - Can start workouts week 2-3
   - Build to two quality sessions per week

5. **Performance focus**:
   - Can be more aggressive with goal
   - Still need monitoring and recovery

## Warning Signs & Intervention

### Yellow Flags (Caution - Monitor Closely)

- Persistent muscle soreness lasting >48 hours
- Minor aches that don't worsen during run
- Fatigue but able to complete workouts
- Slight mood changes or decreased motivation
- ACWR creeping toward 1.3-1.4

**Action:**
- Reduce upcoming week by 10-20%
- Take extra rest day
- Make next workout easier
- Monitor progression closely

### Red Flags (Stop/Reduce Immediately)

- Pain that increases during run
- Pain lasting >24 hours after run
- Pain that affects running gait
- Extreme fatigue unable to complete planned runs
- Resting heart rate elevated >10 bpm from baseline
- Multiple poor workouts in a row
- Sleep disturbances, appetite changes
- ACWR >1.5 for multiple weeks

**Action:**
- Take 2-3 complete rest days
- Drop volume 30-50% for following week
- No quality workouts until resolved
- Consider medical evaluation if pain persists
- Reassess training plan timeline

### Black Flags (Immediate Stop)

- Acute sharp pain
- Pain severity >6/10
- Limping or altered gait
- Swelling, bruising, or visible injury
- Severe systemic symptoms (dizziness, chest pain)

**Action:**
- Stop running immediately
- Seek medical attention
- Complete rest until medical clearance
- Will need modified return-to-running plan

## Age-Specific Considerations

### Runners Under 30
- Generally more resilient tissue
- Can handle standard progression
- Still need proper recovery
- Watch for overuse in high-volume periods

### Runners 30-40
- Slight decrease in recovery speed
- May need extra emphasis on mobility/strength
- Standard progression usually fine
- Be more cautious if new to running

### Runners 40-50
- Tissue adaptation slows
- Recovery takes longer (48-72 hours needed after hard efforts)
- More conservative progression recommended
- Emphasize strength training and mobility
- May need extra easy days between hard efforts

### Runners 50+
- Significant decrease in recovery speed
- Increased injury risk, especially bone stress
- Very conservative progression essential
- Strength training becomes critical
- Consider 2:1 or 3:1 easy-to-hard day ratio
- May benefit from walking breaks on long runs
- Extended warmups and cooldowns important

## Return from Injury Protocol

If runner has recent injury (within 6 months):

### Week 1-2: Gentle Return
- Start at 50% of pre-injury volume
- All easy running
- Run/walk if needed
- No back-to-back days initially

### Week 3-4: Gradual Build
- Increase to 70% of pre-injury volume
- Can add consecutive running days
- Still all easy pace
- Monitor injury site closely

### Week 5-6: Approach Normal
- Build toward 85-90% pre-injury volume
- Can introduce strides
- Consider one easy fartlek

### Week 7-8: Full Return
- Return to normal volume
- Can introduce one workout
- Continue monitoring

**Throughout:**
- Any return of pain = drop back a phase
- Should feel "boring" and too easy
- Better too slow than too fast
- Don't race this process

## Strength Training Integration

Recommend incorporating strength training for injury prevention:

### Minimal Viable Strength Program (2Ã—/week)
- Single-leg squats or lunges
- Calf raises
- Bridges/hip thrusts  
- Planks
- Clamshells
- 10-15 minutes total

### Benefits
- Reduces injury risk by 30-50%
- Improves running economy
- Addresses muscular imbalances
- Particularly important for:
  - Runners 40+
  - Those with injury history
  - High-volume training

### Integration
- Schedule on easy run days or after easy runs
- Not on day before hard workouts
- Counts toward overall training stress
- Start light and progress gradually

## Communication in Training Plans

When presenting risk assessment and plan adjustments:

**DO:**
- Be clear about reasoning
- Explain why conservative approach is chosen
- Emphasize injury prevention as priority
- Provide flexibility and alternatives
- Empower runner to listen to their body

**DON'T:**
- Sound alarmist or scary
- Make runner feel bad about injury history
- Present only one rigid option
- Ignore runner's input on risk tolerance

**Example phrasing:**
"Given that you had an IT band issue 4 months ago and are stepping up from 10K to half marathon, I'm recommending a more gradual progression with extra focus on easy mileage. This approach gives your body time to adapt while still getting you to your goal. We'll build in flexibility so if you're feeling great, we can adjust, but safety and consistency are our top priorities."
